# pca
## Personal Certificate Authority

## Description
pca is a shell script the allows for the easy creation and maintenance of a small Certificate
Authority.  This script will not replace more professional application.  However its learning
curve is almost 0.

The script makes extensive use of openssl(1).  There are many things to not like about the
openssl cli.  This script tries to hide the rough edges and create a pleasent and uniform expierence.


## History
This script started life as a Makefile.  Eventually the Makefile limitations were irritating
enough to drive a rewrite.
