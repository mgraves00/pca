# pca
## Personal Certificate Authority

## Description
pca is a shell script the allows for the easy creation and maintenance of a small Certificate
Authority.  This script will not replace more professional application.  However it learning
curve is almost 0.

The script makes extensive use of openssl(1).  While there are many things to not like about
openssl the script tries to hide the rough edges and create a pleasent and uniform expierence.


## History
This script started life as a Makefile.  Eventually the Makefile limmitations were irritating
enough to drive a rewrite.
